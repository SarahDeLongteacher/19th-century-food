      "Word \"sauce\" found in line 19: \"Christmas Dinner This table should be laid as for any other company dinner, the necessary adjuncts being at had on the sideboard or another table, as heretofore directed. It is a modern fancy to introduce a centre cloth of embroidered linen, or squares and ovals of plush, on which the epergne is set; but practical housekeepers would generally prefer a low dish of ferns or scarlet geraniums mingled with white carnations, having for a base a round mirror whose outer edge could be hidden under a wreath of evergreen, and upon whose surface some stray leaves or blossoms have fallen as if by accident. In cities and towns, where raw oysters can be had, they are often used as a first course. They should be opened and the shell washed an hour or so before dinner, and be put in a cold place. When wanted for the table, if one has not proper oyster-plates, arrange six of these shells, with an oyster in each, on a dessert-plate, with the narrow part of the shell inward, all meeting in the centre, where two or three slices of lemon are laid. Small crackers are passed, in addition to the bread on the napkin, and the pepper and the salt should be within reach. The second course may be breaded mutton-chops, accompanied with canned French peas. A haunch of venison and boiled cauliflower, with drawn butter poured over the latter, would make an acceptable second course. The venison should be purchased several days in advance and hung in a cool place, and should be washed off five or six times with vinegar. On Christmas morning it should be washed with warm water, with a dash of cold water at the last. The wipe perfectly dry and enclose it in a covering of dough made of flour and water rolled into a thickness of not more than half an inch. Encase this in two layers of white wrapping-paper and secure with a string. Fill a dripping-pan a third full of hot water and baste often, adding to it from the tea-kettle as it evaporates. Frequent basting will keep the paper from scorching; and when thoroughly cooked--which will require from two to three hours--take form the oven about three-fourths of an hour before dinner, remove all the coverings, rub well with butter and dredge with flour, and then return to the oven. Repeat this butter-basting two or three times, till the meat is nicely browned and a 'glaze' formed. Garnish the venison with alternate slices of lemon and pickled beet-root. Season the gravy with a large spoonful of currant jelly and the juice of half a lemon. Other suitable vegetables to be passed with venison are mashed turnips, mashed potato, or sweet potato. If a turkey is thought to be a necessity to complete the Christmas dinner, he should be prepared for the table as directed on page 119. When dished, it will be an improvement to garnish him with oysters carefully crumbed and fried. Cranberry sauce should be passed with roast turkey. Chicken salad may follow this course, cheese and crackers coming next. Everything save the ornamental centre- piece will now be removed from the table, and the crumbs brushed from the cloth, making the entrance of the mince-pies, fruits, nuts, and raisins now in order. Ices will be relished after highly-seasoned pastries, and light fancy cakes may be passed with them. Oranges, grapes, and the late pears are ordinarily offered, and last of all should come the little cups of black coffee, accompanied by cream and sugar. it should be of good strength, as we fully assent to the statement that 'well-bred and sensible people do not affect pale and watery decoctions after a hearty dinner.'\"\n",

      "Word \"sauce\" found in line 127: \"'What shall we have for Christmas dinner?' that is a question that challenges every housewife as the holiday approaches. Certain things she must have--or at least tradition says she must have-as fowl and cranberry sauce, and mince pie or Christmas pudding, and then there are the usual items, but not absolutely required by rule, as stuffing with the fowl, and rich giblet gravy and sweet and Irish potatoes, some kind of salad and fruit cake. It would seem from the foregoing list that Christmas dinner is pretty well prescribed, cut and dried, and requires no thought or planning on the part of the one who is to be responsible for it. This assumption, however, is far from the truth. Greater choice is possible than seems so on the surface, and the feast may be a success or a failure in direct proportion to the wisdom with which it is planned....It is probably impossible to prevent a degree of overeating at Christmas dinner-- we are all 'big children' when it comes to that--but certain precautions may be taken. For instance, the mother of the family may see to it the quality of food materials for her Christmas dinner is of the best, and she may see the big dinner is preceded by a simple breakfast, including pure fruit juices and perhaps a cereal. Whole wheat grain cereal would be excellent, since it prepares the system for the big dinner to come by regulating the eliminating organs and stimulating the system...Now for the Christmas dinner menu itself. A little common sense here will be worth a deal of remedies later. Why not start with a clear soup? This prepares the stomach for the heavy food, does not contribute much food value and helps in preventing overeating by filling the stomach with a light liquid at the start that stimulates the action of the digestive fluids. Chicken turkey or roast pig may follow, with potatoes, baked preferred to other ways of cooking...of serving both sweet and white potatoes, a rather absurd custom, is never more out of place than at the heaviest dinner of the year, so why not dispense with it? Creamed onions, squash and lettuce are important vegetables, full of important minerals without being heavy; they can well have their place at our dinner...We probably will not be sensible enough--most of us won't--to leave our plum pudding and our mince pie till the day after Christmas, when it would have twice the flavor, served with a light main meal. Therefore let us at least remember to serve small portions, to let a little time elapse between these rich desserts and the main meal, and to let them come as late in the meal as possible, after the fruit and nuts...Candy, if it is served, should be purchased with great care, Let is be only what you know to be pure, fresh and well made. The final words of advice for the successful Christmas dinner are: First, eliminate judiciously from the menu--don't overload it; second, have plenty of the lighter vegetables that give bulk without heaviness; third, supply fruit juices; fourth, see that every bit of food is of the best. So we will preserve our Christmas cheer, not only while the food is assailing our eyes and nostrils and is in our mouths, but twelve hours afterward.\"\n",

      "Word \"sauce\" found in line 19: \"Christmas Dinner This table should be laid as for any other company dinner, the necessary adjuncts being at had on the sideboard or another table, as heretofore directed. It is a modern fancy to introduce a centre cloth of embroidered linen, or squares and ovals of plush, on which the epergne is set; but practical housekeepers would generally prefer a low dish of ferns or scarlet geraniums mingled with white carnations, having for a base a round mirror whose outer edge could be hidden under a wreath of evergreen, and upon whose surface some stray leaves or blossoms have fallen as if by accident. In cities and towns, where raw oysters can be had, they are often used as a first course. They should be opened and the shell washed an hour or so before dinner, and be put in a cold place. When wanted for the table, if one has not proper oyster-plates, arrange six of these shells, with an oyster in each, on a dessert-plate, with the narrow part of the shell inward, all meeting in the centre, where two or three slices of lemon are laid. Small crackers are passed, in addition to the bread on the napkin, and the pepper and the salt should be within reach. The second course may be breaded mutton-chops, accompanied with canned French peas. A haunch of venison and boiled cauliflower, with drawn butter poured over the latter, would make an acceptable second course. The venison should be purchased several days in advance and hung in a cool place, and should be washed off five or six times with vinegar. On Christmas morning it should be washed with warm water, with a dash of cold water at the last. The wipe perfectly dry and enclose it in a covering of dough made of flour and water rolled into a thickness of not more than half an inch. Encase this in two layers of white wrapping-paper and secure with a string. Fill a dripping-pan a third full of hot water and baste often, adding to it from the tea-kettle as it evaporates. Frequent basting will keep the paper from scorching; and when thoroughly cooked--which will require from two to three hours--take form the oven about three-fourths of an hour before dinner, remove all the coverings, rub well with butter and dredge with flour, and then return to the oven. Repeat this butter-basting two or three times, till the meat is nicely browned and a 'glaze' formed. Garnish the venison with alternate slices of lemon and pickled beet-root. Season the gravy with a large spoonful of currant jelly and the juice of half a lemon. Other suitable vegetables to be passed with venison are mashed turnips, mashed potato, or sweet potato. If a turkey is thought to be a necessity to complete the Christmas dinner, he should be prepared for the table as directed on page 119. When dished, it will be an improvement to garnish him with oysters carefully crumbed and fried. Cranberry sauce should be passed with roast turkey. Chicken salad may follow this course, cheese and crackers coming next. Everything save the ornamental centre- piece will now be removed from the table, and the crumbs brushed from the cloth, making the entrance of the mince-pies, fruits, nuts, and raisins now in order. Ices will be relished after highly-seasoned pastries, and light fancy cakes may be passed with them. Oranges, grapes, and the late pears are ordinarily offered, and last of all should come the little cups of black coffee, accompanied by cream and sugar. it should be of good strength, as we fully assent to the statement that 'well-bred and sensible people do not affect pale and watery decoctions after a hearty dinner.'\"\n",

      "Word \"sauce\" found in line 127: \"'What shall we have for Christmas dinner?' that is a question that challenges every housewife as the holiday approaches. Certain things she must have--or at least tradition says she must have-as fowl and cranberry sauce, and mince pie or Christmas pudding, and then there are the usual items, but not absolutely required by rule, as stuffing with the fowl, and rich giblet gravy and sweet and Irish potatoes, some kind of salad and fruit cake. It would seem from the foregoing list that Christmas dinner is pretty well prescribed, cut and dried, and requires no thought or planning on the part of the one who is to be responsible for it. This assumption, however, is far from the truth. Greater choice is possible than seems so on the surface, and the feast may be a success or a failure in direct proportion to the wisdom with which it is planned....It is probably impossible to prevent a degree of overeating at Christmas dinner-- we are all 'big children' when it comes to that--but certain precautions may be taken. For instance, the mother of the family may see to it the quality of food materials for her Christmas dinner is of the best, and she may see the big dinner is preceded by a simple breakfast, including pure fruit juices and perhaps a cereal. Whole wheat grain cereal would be excellent, since it prepares the system for the big dinner to come by regulating the eliminating organs and stimulating the system...Now for the Christmas dinner menu itself. A little common sense here will be worth a deal of remedies later. Why not start with a clear soup? This prepares the stomach for the heavy food, does not contribute much food value and helps in preventing overeating by filling the stomach with a light liquid at the start that stimulates the action of the digestive fluids. Chicken turkey or roast pig may follow, with potatoes, baked preferred to other ways of cooking...of serving both sweet and white potatoes, a rather absurd custom, is never more out of place than at the heaviest dinner of the year, so why not dispense with it? Creamed onions, squash and lettuce are important vegetables, full of important minerals without being heavy; they can well have their place at our dinner...We probably will not be sensible enough--most of us won't--to leave our plum pudding and our mince pie till the day after Christmas, when it would have twice the flavor, served with a light main meal. Therefore let us at least remember to serve small portions, to let a little time elapse between these rich desserts and the main meal, and to let them come as late in the meal as possible, after the fruit and nuts...Candy, if it is served, should be purchased with great care, Let is be only what you know to be pure, fresh and well made. The final words of advice for the successful Christmas dinner are: First, eliminate judiciously from the menu--don't overload it; second, have plenty of the lighter vegetables that give bulk without heaviness; third, supply fruit juices; fourth, see that every bit of food is of the best. So we will preserve our Christmas cheer, not only while the food is assailing our eyes and nostrils and is in our mouths, but twelve hours afterward.\"\n",
